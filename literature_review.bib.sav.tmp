  abstract   = {Social media tools have become ubiquitous. You can see our students use them all the time.
Among them most popular tools are Facebook, Wiki, YouTube, bulletin board, LinkedIn, blogging,
and twittering. The advancement of modern technologies tries its best to accommodate the needs
from people, especially the younger generation. As educators, how can we take advantage of this
momentum? This paper will share a research study that was conducted in fall of 2009 at the central
campus of the University of Houston. The study investigated student’s use of different social media
tools, their perceptions and attitudes towards these tools, and their preference of social networking
groups. The results show that the three top-used social media tools are Facebook, Wikipedia and
YouTube; the top four reasons for using social media tools are for social engagement, direction
communication, speed of feedback, and relationship building. Regarding social networking group,
they preferred a group of civically engaged and no membership required as well as a group based
on contemporary topic that may not last long. Based on their input, the author suggested some
educational implications of some of these tools as a valuable resource for teaching and learning.},
  comment    = {Social Media Tools As A Learning Resource
Methodology
The study was conducted with a qualitative and quantitative approach employing a survey to gather data.
This paper concludes that technology should assist and improve teaching efficiency while enhancing student learning experiences. These social media tools are already existing among students and the students feel comfortable using social media. The paper also states that ‘intelligent adoption of social media tools can engage students in interactive learning, which is a key to a successful education.’ Youmei Liu also acknowledges that using social media tools in teaching sometimes can be very challenging to instructors and that students can be a very good consulting source, as the students are the experts, as they have a better understanding of the tools. The paper concludes that the future integration of technology in education should focus what students use instead of what the school wants them to use to guarantee maximum efficiency.},

  abstract   = {With the world in the midst of a social media
revolution, it is more than obvious that social media like
Facebook, twitter, orkut, MySpace, Skype etc., are used
extensively for the purpose of communication. One of the most
important advantages of the use of social media is the online
sharing of knowledge and information among the different
groups of people. This online sharing of information also
promotes the increase in the communication skills among the
people especially among the learners/students of educational
institutions. Online tools and technology has not only mediated
communication in countless ways, but that the very ways we
communicate and even the ways we talk and think about
communication are changing as a result. Social media have the
potential to fundamentally change the character of our social
lives, both on an interpersonal and a community level.},
  comment    = {Methodology
The study employs a qualitative and quantitative analysis to empirically examine the effectiveness of social media via survey, as this was found to be the most appropriate method. This paper examined data from primary and secondary sources, primary being the data collected from the conducted survey, secondary being from online sources, magazines and journals.
The paper concludes that collaboration through online mediums become easy as long as it is facilitated by the platform. This is made easy by features allowing users to co-draft documents, organize members, arrange meetings, spread information and gauge opinion. It also notes that there will be a greater capacity for groups to participate in collective action, which is the hallmark of civil society. And that social media technologies are capable of reaching audiences all over the world.},

on business communication pedagogy. Specifically, we will be
sharing the experience and providing some analysis related to
implementation of social media into MBA courses at the University
of Texas at Austin. We begin by placing the use of social media
within the broader theoretical context of social constructivism.
Many principles of social constructivism coincide with the ways that
social media enhances learning in our everyday lives. Second, we
present the background and strategy behind the implementation of
blogs, photo databases, and student-generated video clips assigned
in an MBA course that included a 2-week study tour in China. We
then end with some recommendations and observations for further
implementation.},
  comment    = {Methodology
The students examined in the study were given iPods to blog with whilst on a trip to China
This study found that implementing a social media aspect to a study tour in China saw the students working more collaboratively and all had a sense of team. It also observed a sense of working toward a goal. It concludes with ‘Truly, the secret for us educators is to observe how technology is used in every day life and then implement that use in out educational situations.’},

  abstract   = {Social media is a platform for public around the World to discuss their issues and opinions. Before knowing the
actual aspects of social media people must have to know what does social media mean? Social media is a term used to
describe the interaction between groups or individuals in which they produce, share, and sometimes exchange ideas, images,
videos and many more over the internet and in virtual communities. Children are growing up surrounded by mobile devices
and interactive social networking sites such as Twitter, MySpace, and Facebook, Orkut which has made the social media a
vital aspect of their life. Social network is transforming the behavior in which youthful people relate with their parents, peers,
as well as how they make use of technology. The effects of social networking are twofold.[1] On the positive side, social
networks can act as invaluable tools for professionals. They achieve this by assisting young professionals to market their skills
and seek business opportunities. Social networking sites may also be used to network efficiently. On the negative side, the
internet is laden with a number of risks associated with online communities. Cyber bullying, which means a type of
harassment that is perpetrated using electronic technology, is one of the risks. In this paper we cover every aspect of social
media with its positive and negative effects. Focus is on the particular field like health, business, education, society and youth.
During this paper we explain how these media will influence the society in a broad way.},
  comment    = {This paper employs on site observations, interviews and questionnaires/surveys to gather data.
The paper concludes noting things such as ‘online networking has expanded the quality and rate of coordinated effort for students’, Social media has different merits and likewise has a few faults which influence individuals. False data can lead the training framework to disappointment. And finally, all the citizens are advised to adopt the positive aspects of social media and avoid negative effects.},

  abstract   = {As social media sites continue to grow in popularity, it is our premise that
technology is a vital part in today’s student success equation. This descriptive,
exploratory research study drew a random sample (N=48) of males (n=26) and females
(n=22) who were administered a student perception questionnaire on how social media
affects college students. Thirty-five percent of the participants were undergraduates and
65% were graduate students, studying at Johnson & Wales University. Thirty-one percent
of participants have full-time jobs, 30% have part-time jobs and 39% do not have jobs.
The results of the survey questionnaire indicate that 45% of the sample admitted that they
spent 6-8 hours per day checking social media sites, while 23% spent more than 8 hours;
20% spent 2-4 hours and only 12% spent less than 2 hours on this task. Results indicate
while most college students use social media and spend many hours checking social
media sites, there was a negative aspect to college students’ use of social media.},
  comment    = {Methodology
This paper used an anonymous survey to collect data from 50 college students (35% were undergraduate while 65% were graduate)

This paper notes that college students were likely to be affected by social media  and that it offers not only  a world in which to make new friends, but is also a good way to release pressure. It also highlights that it absolutely affects students lives and also their grades, calling for an approach to better balance the relationship between social media and academic study. 
This paper also states that 3-4 weeks may have been too shorter time-span to conduct the study, and that the sample size of the surveyed students may have been too small. It also notes that for future research, it may be more helpful to measure the social presence besides motivation and pressure, examining how a students psychological state influences motivations for social media use.},

The paper talks about the connection between social media and anxiety – It states that social media causes depression anxiety in two ways. Chronic stress causes depression anxiety. Being constantly alert for new social media messages, to your instinctive fight or flight limbic system, is the same as being on continuous alert for predators, which causes a release of the stress hormone cortisol. The second cause of depression anxiety is from constantly trying to maintain an unrealistic and unachievable image of oneself on their chosen social network.
Catfishing.
The paper also mentions that social media can pave the way for criminal activity, by putting to use the freedoms offered by social media to hide their identity and engage in things like cyber bullying, cyber terrorism, human trafficking and drug dealing, though only talks in depth of cyber bullying, criminal and terrorist activities as they are the most common illicit activities.

The paper concludes with a note saying that despite the positive benefit of rapid information sharing, social media enables people to create false identities and superficial connections, causes depression and is a primary recruiting tool of criminals and terrorists. It also mentions that the negative impacts of social media are rarely discussed, while the benefits are often emphasized.},

It also recognises that social media platforms could be used to allow individuals to access evidence based treatments and support.

  comment = {This paper conducted a study that identified that adolescents perceived social media as being a threat to mental health in 3 ways; 1) it was believed to cause mood and anxiety disorders for some adolescents, (2) it was viewed as a platform for cyberbullying, and (3) the use of social media itself  was often framed as a kind of ‘addiction’.
It also mentions in the papers abstract that future research should focus on targeting and utilising social media for promoting mental wellbeing among adolescents and educating youth to manage the possible deleterious effects.
In the findings of the research, it noted consistent negative views about the potential impact of social media on mental health. While there was some recognition of the possible positive effects, the overwhelming consensus amongst participants was that social media was dangerous for adolescent mental health in a broad sense, but mostly referring to the mental health of others rather than their own.
The paper concludes stating that rather than demonising the process, they way forward may be for adolescents to be actively involved in the development of programmes that identify the way to successfully navigate social media. And that we need to find ways to utilise social media in a more positive way, and in ways that promote positive wellbeing in this group. It ends on a note that adolescents need educating about the meanings of mental health and wellbeing, as well as about mental illness and the ways of preventing this or managing it if they are diagnosed with a condition.},
