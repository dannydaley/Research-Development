\section{Introduction}
    Finding your place socially at university can be very daunting,
    especially if you have been unable to find your way into any large
    social events, or onto any student run social channels such as Discord
    etc, if any such things are in place at all. Failure to find such
    places can have a major impact on not only the university experience,
    but also their mental health, as they can find themselves isolated. I
    plan to research into the question; could a social media platform embedded
    into higher education institutions be of a benefit to students starting
    university by aiding their integration into their new social setting.
\section{Literature review}
	This literature review investigates the risks and benefits attached to
    social media and the potentital advantages that it could bring forward as a
    tool in higher education and pedagogy. Social media has made a massive
    impact on society in many ways, and using it one way or another has become
    commonplace in most of our lives, but do we fully understand the risks and
    advantages that it presents? This literary analysis of recent (2010-2022)
    research papers aims to explore findings on the possible side effects of
    social media in an effort to weigh the pros against the cons in regard to
    the integration of social media with higher education (HE) and pedagogy. We
    hypothesize, that with proper application, social media could become a valuable
    tool within HE institutions and could help increase engagement with learning
    materials and courses.
\subsection{Social Media in Higher Education}
    Liu \cite{Liu2010}  acknowledges that each social media platform comes with
    its own set of strengths and weaknesses and that the integration of such into
    pedagogy must be planned cautiously, ensuring that it is the platforms strengths
    that are leveraged and not the potential distractions and difficulties that could
    hinder student learning. Liu talks of each social media platform being a tool,
    each in its own specific right and each with its designated purpose, so a one size
    fits all approach would only bring about nuisance. The author notes, for instance,
    that we could capitalize on Facebook's ubiquity and capabilities for collaboration.
    Liu \cite{Liu2010} and Baruah \cite{Baruah2012} both talk about the integration of
    social media into higher education and both conclude sharing their thought on that
    it would be an advantage to implement social media elements as tools within higher
    education. Baruah further empowers Liu's point about different platform providing
    different tools, by discussing how much easier collaboration becomes when using
    online facilities. Online mediums that provide the features allowing users to co-draft
    documents, organize members, arrange meetings, spread information and guage opinion,
    all while having the capability to reach audiences all over the world.
    Wang concludes that there will be a greater capacity for groups to participate in
    collective action, going on to say that it is the hallmark of civil society.
    Kelm \cite{Kelm2011} also implemented social media into their course and noticed an
    increase in engagement from their students and reported a greater sense of team ethic
    between classmates.Kelm conluded with a note stating that the secret for educators is
    to observe how technology is used in everyday life and then implement that use into
    our education systems.
    Wang et al. \cite{Wang2011} mentions in the paper that there is a call for an approach
    to try and better balance the relationship between social media and academic study but
    pays a great deal of respect to the potential benefits that it can offer. The paper goes
    on to mention that students are very likely to be affected by social media, whilst it
    provides a world in which to make new friends and release pressure, it can absolutely
    impact students lives and grades, calling for the aforementioned balance.
    Evans \cite{Evans2014} encouraged students to interact with him and their peers through
    Twitter and found that the amount of Twitter usage was associated with increased student
    engagement. Course related tweeting showed no evidence of being realted to interpersonal
    relations vetween students and their tutor, and finally that Twitter usage did not relate
    to class attendance.

    Williams \cite{Williams2022} talks of the capabilities that social media brings
    forward as advantages in enhancing learner engagement in a very effiecient way
    and reiterates the points provided by Junco et al \cite{Junco et al 2013}.
    The paper from Junco et al, follows a similar experiment to Evans and his 2014
    paper \cite{Evans2014} but in a slightly more robust and comprehensive fashion.
    This was achieved by using two seperate groups, the first consisting of 125
    students, half of which were required to use Twitter while the other half were
    required to use Ning, whereas the participation of Twitter and Ning usage was
    voluntary for study group 2. The study recognised greater motivation towards
    engagement from study group 1 (those required to use Twitter and Ning). The
    paper concludes stating that new technologies being incorporated into contempory
    classrooms is an important development in an effort to produce more effective
    learning strategies and outcomes, while calling for contempory students to
    improve their capacity to engage in more self-directed collaborative practices
    in order to better take ownership of their learning.

    Tripathi \cite{Tripathi 2022} observed that nearly two-thirds of faculty at
    their institution had used social media in a class session, some even
    posting content for students to further read outside of classes, which saw
    promising levels of engagement while other members of faculty ask students
    explicitly to utilise social media as part of course assignments. On an end
    note the paper reaffirms that the presence of social media within HE is
    increasingly visible as instructors continue to further employ technology
    to enhance their teaching methods and promote active learning for students.


\subsection{The Effects of Social Media}

\section{methodology}
    Talk about the methodology, all of the papers I have read so far that conduct
    any kind of data collection, all do so through online survey, which greatly
    justifies my chosen method. I will conduct a within participant study to survey
    a collection of first year students on their experience of starting university.
    This will be around week 7 (after reading week). We will research into how they
    found integrating into their new social environment and if they have been able to
    find their cohort socially. We will question how they have been coping mentally,
    whether they have attended any student union events, or engaged in any other
    activities such as group gaming session. We will also look into how current
    iterations of social media have played a role in their experience so far.

    The same group of students will then be surveyed again through means of within
    participant study after week 7 of semester 2 after some exposure to my prototype
    platform to gauge if they think that such a platform would have been of a benefit
    to them when they started university.

    We have chosen a within participant study as opposed to A/B
    testing as we will not be subjecting testers to side-by-side
    version of the platform with some form of variable
    changed. By design of the within participant study,
    testers will be subjected to all features and functions of the
    website.

If you have an EPS/PDF photo (graphicx package needed), extra braces are
 needed around the contents of the optional argument to biography to prevent
 the LaTeX parser from getting confused when it sees the complicated

 your own custom macro containing the $\backslash${\tt{includegraphics}} command to make things
 simpler here.)
